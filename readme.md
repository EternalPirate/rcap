couple notes about design:

1. The design is not perfectly centred, I was wanting to make conversion pixel perfect but it's super hard because of this.
2. Strange UX behaviour for car cards, when we open bids bottom cars shifted, and this is not best UX, it can be improved by overlapping the next bottom card and not push it when the list is visible (just a proposal).
3. Some elements are not fully thought out like pagination

regarding the test:

It's possible to improve assets situation by making a icons font via font's generators like this https://glyphter.com/, so we will have one font file that is easy to use and better in usage (but some svg icons are broken and need designer help), or other option is to make a sprite from png icons, so we will have one png img with all icons. But I can't spend much time on this free test project.

Also I've used only one breakpoint to save time, in best scenario we should have 3-4 breakpoints
